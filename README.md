# BiasBreakers: An Interactive Chat-Based Game to Combat Workplace Bias

## Inspiration
BiasBreakers was inspired by the need to empower individuals to recognize, challenge, and counteract workplace inequalities. This interactive game simulates real-life workplace scenarios, encouraging users to navigate issues such as pay disparity, microaggressions, and leadership bias. By presenting these situations in a safe and guided environment, BiasBreakers equips users with skills and confidence to handle these situations effectively, fostering empathy, allyship, and advocacy.

## What it Does
BiasBreakers is a chat-based game that allows users to experience and respond to workplace biases. Users are presented with scenarios and multiple-choice options, and they receive feedback based on their choices. Each scenario focuses on different aspects of workplace inequality, allowing users to:
- Recognize bias in common workplace scenarios like credit-taking, promotion bias, and pay gaps.
- Respond to microaggressions and cultural insensitivity with a thoughtful approach.
- Learn and practice allyship and advocacy, especially in male-dominated fields.

Example scenarios include:

- **Scenario 1: Addressing Internalized Sexism and Helping Women Become Better Allies**  
   A woman frequently aligns herself with male colleagues and dismisses other women’s concerns about gender bias, reflecting internalized sexism. She downplays issues like gender inequality and workplace discrimination. The scenario focuses on how to engage her in a constructive conversation to help her understand the importance of being an ally to other women and promoting gender equality in the workplace.

- **Scenario 2: Reporting Sexual Harassment and Facing Potential Workplace Retaliation**  
   A woman experiences sexual harassment in the workplace and considers reporting the issue to HR. She fears that speaking up might lead to retaliation, such as being passed over for promotions or being ostracized by colleagues. The scenario explores how she handles reporting the incident, navigating the company’s response, and dealing with potential backlash.

## How We Built It
BiasBreakers was developed as a web-based game using Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS, and it is hosted on Google Cloud. The game uses a branching decision-making format, where user choices lead to different scenario outcomes, fostering active learning and engagement.
